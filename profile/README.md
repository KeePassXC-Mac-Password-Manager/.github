## What is KeePassXC for Mac?

KeePassXC for Mac is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager that helps you manage your credentials safely. It stores all your passwords and sensitive information in a highly encrypted database, protected by a single master key, key files, or hardware tokens. Designed specifically for macOS, it integrates seamlessly with the system and popular web browsers for a smooth user experience.

This powerful tool goes beyond simple storage. It includes advanced features like auto-type, which automatically fills login forms, TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support for two-factor authentication, and a built-in password generator to create strong, unique passwords for every account. The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy to organize entries into groups and search through your database quickly.

KeePassXC is built with a strong focus on security and privacy. Your data never leaves your local machine, ensuring complete control. It is compatible with databases created by the original KeePass (KDBX 3.1 and 4.0), making it a versatile choice for users migrating from other platforms. Ideal for developers, IT professionals, and anyone serious about digital security.
